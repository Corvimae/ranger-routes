Walk back through route 2 avoiding all encounters

The aim is to get a total of **5150 watts** in the Wild Area to afford **TR08 Thunderbolt and 3 Quick Balls**.  
Ideally, you will also either get the Drifloon raid naturally or find a wishing piece as you pick up items, but if not you will need to get another 3000 watts for a Wishing Piece.  

Also need a minimum of **$68884** from item pick ups (Do not count the money you got from your mum/fights up to this point in this total) to be able to afford all the X-items needed and at least 10 vitamins in the late game but aim to get as much as possible whilst still looking for Drifloon in the raid  
If you are a bit under this amount due to getting Drifloon early, then pick up items that you know sell for a lot during the route, otherwise keep looking for items in the wild area

Common item pick ups and price they sell for:
- Fancy Apple - $1100
- Tiny Mushroom - $250
- Big Mushroom - $2500
- Balm Mushroom - $7500
- Pungent Root - $475
- Revive - $1000
- Honey - $450
- Luxury Ball (If excess watts on Day 7 at Motostoke, cost 100Ws) - $1500
- White Herb - $2000
- Pretty Feather - $500
- Shed Shell - $2000
- TR33 Shadow Ball (only if Lv20 has it already) - $3000

![Drifloon Raid Location](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Corvimae/ranger-routes/main/drifblim-alt-main-sword/assets/raidDenLocationDrifloon.png)

After you raid den manip the first time to Day 1 (19th), get Thunderbolt and 3 Quick Balls from the Motostoke Watt Trader after gathering enough watts

When entering the wild area:-
- Interact with as many raid dens as possible during Day 0 (18th), both with beams and without
- If there is a raid at the Drifloon den, check if it is Drifloon whilst collecting watts on the way to it
    - Make sure to pick up any hidden items whilst doing this to sell on or to hopefully get a Wishing Piece
- Do a raid den manip at your nearest raid den with a raid **not in or near Dappled Grove**
    - If there is a raid at the Drifloon den, go to it whilst collecting watts and items
        - If Drifloon, attempt the raid, do as below, then gather more items if you need more money
    - If no raid/it is not a Drifloon raid, do as below, then do a raid den manip until Drifloon, gathering items as needed

Go get Quick Balls in Dappled Grove on Day 3 (21st) and Thunderbolt on Day 5 (23rd) by Motostoke if unable to gather enough whats in time for Day 1 (19th)

# Catch Drifloon in a Pokeball  
This route has been made for all Drifloons to be runnable, even with terrible stats, just understand though that some situations will be worse than others  
Walk forward to trigger cutscene for Sonia  
Teach Shadow Ball in **Slot 1** or Slot 4, whichever is not Gust, if not Lv 20  
Teach Thunderbolt over **Slot 2** or Slot 4, whichever is not Gust, (move Shadow Ball into Slot 1 if not there already)

Ideally, you want:
- Shadow Ball
- Gust / Thunderbolt
- Any move
- Thunderbolt / Gust

Shopping:
Right:
- Sell all Pokeballs and items that you picked up, then buy:
    - 31 X-SpAtk 	(^^)
    - 2 X-Atk 	    (^^)
    - 9 X-Def	      (v)
    - 3 X-SpDef	    (>)

Skip the schoolgirl by slightly hugging the wall, but not too much

You can also wait until she looks to the right where she won't see you if you hug the wall at all
